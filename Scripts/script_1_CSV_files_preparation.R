#### SCRIPTS FOR ANALYSING HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES: Calculation of Runoff coefficient and Baseflow index ####
#### Script 1: Creating csv files ####

   # Methodology: two csv files are necessary to perform this methodology. These files can be created from two vector layers; one 
   # with the basins delineated, and the other with the grid of weather data. This script can be used as example to create these csv
   # files.
   
   # Used libraries
   library(sf)
   library(tidyverse)
