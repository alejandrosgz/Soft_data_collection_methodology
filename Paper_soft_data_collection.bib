After reviewing the fundamentals of vector optimization theory and the algorithmic issues, we link the multi-criteria calibration approach with the concepts of uncertainty and equifinality. Specifically, the multi-criteria framework enables recognition and handling of errors and uncertainties, and detection of prominent behavioural solutions with acceptable trade-offs. Particularly in models of complex parameterization, a multi-objective approach becomes essential for improving the identifiability of parameters and augmenting the information contained in calibration by means of both multi-response measurements and empirical metrics (“soft” data), which account for the hydrological expertise. Based on the literature review, we also provide alternative techniques for dealing with conflicting and non-commeasurable criteria, and hybrid strategies to utilize the information gained towards identifying promising compromise solutions that ensure consistent and reliable calibrations.

	abstract = {Hydrological models are frequently used for water resources management. One of the most widely used is the Soil and Water Assessment Tool ({SWAT}). However, one weakness of {SWAT} is its simplicity in modeling groundwater, which might affect the representation of hydrological processes. Therefore, modeling strategies that are geared towards achieving more realistic simulations would increase the reliability and credibility of {SWAT} model predictions. In this study, the performance of a {SWAT} model in a geologically heterogeneous basin was optimized by incorporating geological properties through semi-automatic calibration strategies. Based on its geology, the basin was split into four regions, and a default calibration (Scheme I) was compared with three designed calibration schemes: a zonal calibration (Scheme {II}), obtaining a parameter set in each of the regions, a zonal calibration after introducing an impervious layer in an aquifuge region (Scheme {III}), and a final calibration scheme (Scheme {IV}) where an aquifer region was re-calibrated, changing a parameter controlling the required content of water in the aquifer for return flow to increase groundwater flow. The results from the four schemes were evaluated both statistically and by assessing their plausibility to determine which one resulted in the best model performance and the most realistic simulations. All schemes resulted in a satisfactory statistical model performance, but the sequential optimization in the final scheme realistically reproduced the heterogenous hydrological behavior of the geological regions within the basin. To the best of our knowledge, our work addresses this issue for the first time, providing new insights about how to simulate catchments including aquifuge substrates.},

They are useful for catchment comparison to understand how different landscapes “filter” rainfall into eventbased runoff and to explain the observed differences with catchment characteristics and related runoff mechanisms. However, the big drawback of this important parameter is the lack of a standard hydrograph separation method preceding its calculation. Event-based runoff coefficients determined with four well-established separation methods, as well as a newly developed separation method, are compared and are shown to differ considerably. This signifies that runoff coefficients reported in the literature often convey less information than required to allow for catchment classification. The new separation technique (constant-k method) is based on the theory of linear storage. Its advantages are that it is theoretically based in determining the end point of an event and that it can also be applied to events with multiple peaks. Furthermore, it is shown that event-based runoff coefficients in combination with simple statistical models improve our understanding of rainfall–runoff response of catchments with sparse data.},

	abstract = {Recursive digital filtering of hydrographs is a baseflow separation method that can easily be automated and has been recommended for providing reproducible results. In the past, different formulations of the most simple filter type, the so-called one-parameter filter, have been proposed. In this paper, a theoretical framework is developed for filter algorithms that were constructed under the assumption that the outflow from an aquifer is linearly proportional to its storage. It is shown that these one-parameter filters describing an exponential baseflow recession are all special cases of a two-parameter filter whose equation is specified. Its parameters are the recession constant—which can be objectively determined by a recession analysis—and {BFImax}, the maximum value of the baseflow index that can be modelled by the algorithm. This introduces a subjective element into the baseflow calculation, since {BFImax} is not measurable. A preliminary analysis based on the results of conventional separation techniques shows that it might be possible to find typical {BFImax} values for classes of catchments that can be unequivocally distinguished by their hydrological and hydrogeological characteristics.

	abstract = {Simple hydraulic models for outflow of groundwater into a stream suggest that the form of the storage–discharge relationship for groundwater changes from linear, for a confined aquifer, to quadratic, for an unconfined flow. Tests of the form of stream flow recessions in 11 streams, during periods of no recharge, show that for most catchments the storage–discharge relationship is more strongly non-linear than the quadratic form. However, for the commonly occurring case of recessions of duration up to about 10 days, the linear model remains a very good approximation, using a biased value of the groundwater turnover time. In contrast, estimates, from the stream hydrograph, of recharge during a storm event are very sensitive to the form of the storage–discharge relationship. The results of this study also show great variability in the parameters of the recession algorithm from one recession to another, attributable to spatial variability in groundwater recharge. An extension of the linear model to ‘leaky’ catchments, where the recession reaches zero flow, has been tested on two data sets. The second part of the paper deals with algorithms for baseflow during surface runoff events—the problem of hydrograph separation. Algorithms with one, two and three parameters have been compared, using data for the same 11 streams, and the results show significant differences in the baseflow index ({BFI}) predicted for some catchments. The two-parameter algorithm, which is fitted subjectively, is more consistent in providing plausible results than either the one- or three-parameter algorithms, both of which can be fitted objectively.

	abstract = {Discharge in many rivers is often fed by outflow from a shallow groundwater reservoir. It is becoming clear that the outflow from this aquifer is not linearly proportional to storage as is commonly assumed in many algorithms. Numerical analysis of flow recession curves from about 100 river gauging stations instead reveals a nonlinear relationship between baseflow, Q, and storage, S, for which the equation S={aQb} was adopted. Values of the exponent b are found by calibration to be between 0 and 1 but with a high concentration around 0·5, which is in accordance with the findings of other studies and theoretical approaches yielding b=0·5 for unconfined aquifers and relating the coefficient a to catchment properties, primarily area and shape of basin, pore volume and transmissivity. This non-linear reservoir function is proposed as a more realistic alternative to the linear reservoir function. The relatively fast response of groundwater flow to rainfall is mainly a result of the increase of hydraulic head of the groundwater reservoir accelerating the exfiltration of ‘old’, pre-event water into the river bed. As fissure and pore volumes communicate hydraulically, it appears physically reasonable to model the system by one non-linear reservoir for catchments, or parts of them, instead of applying independent parallel linear reservoirs. The non-linear reservoir algorithms are supported by an analytical derivation. They are extended for the automatic separation of baseflow from a time-series of daily discharge in rivers and the computation of storage and effective recharge of groundwater in river basins by inverse nonlinear reservoir routing. The time-series obtained allow the identification and quantification of long-term changes to the water balance. Relationships between computed groundwater storage and observed groundwater level can also be established. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This holistic (as opposed to reductionist) estimation method is demonstrated for the Harris River catchment in southwest Western Australia. The relationship between the groundwater discharge and the reservoir storage of shallow unconfined aquifers was found to be nonlinear based on the analysis of numerous streamflow recession curves. However, depletion of groundwater by evapotranspiration losses, through the water uptake of tree roots, was found to bias the recession curves and the estimated reservoir parameters. As a result of the seasonality of both rainfall and potential evaporation, analysis of the recession curves, stratified according to time of the year, allowed the quantification of evapotranspiration loss as a function of calendar month and stored groundwater storage. Time series of recharge to the groundwater aquifer were computed from the observed total streamflows, and the estimated discharge and evapotranspiration losses, by inverse nonlinear reservoir routing. Using traditional unit hydrograph methods unit recharge responses to rainfall were computed by least squares fitting. The shapes of the estimated unit response functions showed no significant seasonal variation.},

Hydrological modeling is a supportive tool for this analysis, which has been used in this work to assess the climate change impacts on the water resources of three basins under Mediterranean climate (Ompólveda and Salado River basins, in Spain, and Guadalupe River basin, in Mexico). The outcomes of previous climate change scenarios simulation addressed with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool ({SWAT}) have been compiled, evaluating the impacts on the water balance, and focusing on the streamflow components. The potential implications of these effects on energy production have been discussed. The results point to a streamflow reduction by the end of the century around 50\%–60\% in the worst scenarios, with varying effects for each of the streamflow components. In the Spanish catchments, where groundwater contribution dominates in baseline conditions, a noticeable decrease of this component is expected (up to -74\%), becoming lateral flow the main streamflow component. In the Mexican basin, lateral flow, which is already predominant (69\%), will experience the largest absolute decrease, but the highest relative decrease might be experienced by groundwater flow, up to -92\%. Absolute variations in the surface component are small and the different ways to simulate the climate change scenarios might hinder their interpretation. This work shows that water resources will be even more scarce in these regions, being especially worrying the groundwater component reduction, which currently maintains the streamflow during dry periods. This situation would limit energy production both from sources that directly use water, such as hydropower, and others that require water for cooling. Higher atmospheric and water temperatures will increase demands for irrigation and for cooling systems. Therefore, competition for water will rise among key sectors, and an accurate planning considering these factors must be a priority.},

Two cases (Case I: Using observed streamflow data and Case {II}: Using simulated streamflow) were considered to accom­ plish objectives of the study using a widely used watershed model ({SWAT}) and good-quality field data from a well-monitored experimental watershed. Major findings of the study include (1) automated calibration results are sensitive to the objective function group—group that work based on minimization of the absolute deviations (Group I), group that work based on minimization of square of the residuals (Group {II}), and groups that use log of the observed and simulated streamflow values (Group {III})—but not to objective functions within the group; (2) efficiency criteria that belong to Group I were the most effective when used as objective function for accurate simulation of both low flows and high flows; (3) Group I and Group {II} objective functions complement each other’s performance; (4) with regard to the capability to describe goodness of model simulations, efficiency criteria that belong to Group I showed superior robustness; (5) for the study watershed, use of the long-term interannual calendar day mean as baseline model did not improve capability of an efficiency criterion to describe model performance; and (6) even for ideal conditions where uncertainty in input data and model structure are fully accounted for, identifying the so-called global parameters values through calibration could be daunting as parameter values that were significantly divergent from predetermined values produced model simulations that can be considered near perfect even when judged using multiple efficiency criteria.},

Six calibration schemes were tested, varying the objective function and the nutrient fractions targeted. The best performance metrics (R2, {NSE}, {PBIAS}) were obtained when using {NSE} as objective function and targeting N-fractions and P-fractions separately. The scheme was validated in another {SWAT} set-up in northern Denmark. Although {NSE} is often questioned, we found it as an adequate objective function when addressing a multi-site and multi-variable calibration. Our findings may serve as guideline for hydro-ecological modellers, being useful to achieve watershed management goals.},

Spatially, the recession rate of baseflow in loess area is the biggest, but is the smallest in the sandy area.

Consequently, rating metrics can mathematically validate model results as satisfactory even when some of the simulated hydrologic processes are incorrectly represented during the calibration process. In this paper, we argue that to properly represent the hydrologic system, calibration tasks focused on modifying model parameters should account for equifinality, model inadequacy, and constraint inadequacy. To demonstrate our argument, we conducted a traditional calibration using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool ({SWAT}) coupled to the Modular Finite-difference Flow Model ({MODFLOW}) to simulate the hydrologic processes in the Fort Cobb Reservoir Experimental Watershed ({FCREW}) in central western Oklahoma. The results indicated that model calibration based on metrics from a single domain, in this case using {SWAT}, did not necessarily guarantee an appropriate representation of water circulation. Moreover, unsupervised calibration techniques based on the objective-function optimization (e.g., inverse calibration using {SWAT}-{CUP} {SUFI}2 algorithm) may not be sufficient if model constraints in multiple domains are not properly set, resulting in distorted parameters. This practice can result in the misrepresentation of water circulation and can have adverse impacts on environmental model results used to support policies and decisions.},

There has been much recent debate regarding the future of the hydrological sciences, and several publications have voiced opinions on this subject. This opinion paper seeks to comment and expand upon some recent publications that have advocated an increased focus on process-based modeling while de-emphasizing the focus on detailed attention to parameter estimation.

	abstract = {Climate change ({CC}) has a high impact on hydrological processes which calls for reliable projections of {CC} hydrological impacts at large scales. However, there are several challenges in hydrological modelling at large scales. Large-scale models are often not adapted and evaluated at regional scale due to high computation time requirements or lack of information on human interactions, such as dam operations and irrigation practices at local scale. In this study, we present a regionalised methodology that uses a hydrological mass balance calibration ({HMBC}) and global datasets to represent reservoir and irrigation practices and apply these to a {SWAT}+ model for Southern Africa. We evaluate the influence of {HMBC} and the representation on irrigation and reservoirs on model performance and climate projections. We propose a generalised implementation of reservoirs using global datasets and decision tables to represent irrigation and reservoir management. Results show that inclusion of irrigation, reservoirs and {HMBC} leads to improved simulation of discharge and evapotranspiration with fewer iterations than a full parameter calibration. There is a substantial difference between projections made by the regionalised model and default model when looking at local impacts. We conclude that large-scale hydrological studies that involve local analysis and spatial mapping of results benefit from {HMBC} and representation of management practices. The proposed methodology can be scaled up and improve overall projections made by global models.},

	abstract = {Accurate discharge simulation is one of the most common objectives of hydrological modeling studies. However, a good simulation of discharge is not necessarily the result of a realistic simulation of hydrological processes within the catchment. We propose an evaluation framework that considers both discharge and water balance components as evaluation criteria for calibration of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool ({SWAT}). In this study, we integrated average annual values of surface runoff, groundwater flow, and evapotranspiration in the model evaluation procedure to constrain the selection of good model runs for the Little River Experimental Watershed in Georgia, United States. For evaluating water balance and discharge dynamics, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ({NSE}) and percent bias ({PBIAS}) were used. In addition, the ratio of root mean square error and standard deviation of measured data ({RSR}) was calculated for individual segments of the flow duration curve to identify the best model runs in terms of discharge magnitude. Our results indicate that good statistics for discharge do not guarantee realistic simulations of individual water balance components. Therefore, we recommend constraining the ranges of water balance components to achieve a more realistic simulation of the entire hydrological system, even if tradeoffs between good statistics for discharge simulations and reasonable amounts of the water balance components are unavoidable.

	abstract = {Hydrologic and water quality models are increasingly used to determine the environmental impacts of climate variability and land management. Due to differing model objectives and differences in monitored data, there are currently no universally accepted procedures for calibration and validation in the literature. In an effort to develop accepted model calibration and validation procedures or guidelines, a special collection of 22 research articles that present and discuss calibration strategies for 25 hydrologic and water quality models was previously assembled. The models vary in scale temporally as well as spatially from point source to the watershed level. One suggestion for future work was to synthesize relevant information from this special collection and to identify significant calibration and validation topics. The objective of this paper is to discuss the importance of proper model processes representation and its impact on calibration and scenario analysis using the information from these 22 research articles and other relevant literature. In general, if the processes are not accurately represented (i.e. if surface water runoff and/or evapotranspiration is over or underestimated), the nutrient and/or sediment balance will be misjudged. These errors may be amplified at the watershed scale where additional sources and transport processes are simulated. The calibration and validation procedure should consider the accuracy/adequacy of the representation of environmental processes at the appropriate scale of the model given the modelling objectives. To account for processes in calibration, a diagnostic approach is recommended using both hard and soft data. The diagnostic approach looks at signature patterns of behavior of model outputs to determine which processes, and thus parameters, need further adjustment during calibration. This overcomes the weaknesses of traditional regression based calibration by discriminating between multiple processes within a budget. Hard data is defined as long term, measured time series, typically at a point within a watershed. Soft data is defined as information on individual processes within a balance that may not be directly measured within the study area, and may be just an average annual estimate, and may entail considerable uncertainty. The advantage of developing soft data for the calibration is that it requires a basic understanding of processes (water, sediment, nutrient, and carbon budgets) within the spatial area being modeled and constrains the calibration.},

Fifty-four rainfall–runoff events, from December 2004 to September 2007, were used to analyse the principal hydrological patterns and show which factors best explain the hydrological response. The nonlinearity between rainfall and runoff showed that the variability in the hydrological response of the catchment was linked to the seasonal dynamics of the rainfall and, to a lesser extent, to evapotranspiration. The runoff coefficient, estimated as the ratio between direct runoff and rainfall volume, on an event basis, was analysed as a function of rainfall characteristics (amount and intensity) and the initial catchment state conditions prior to an event, such as pre-event baseflow and antecedent rainfall index. The results revealed that the hydrological response depends both on the soil humidity conditions at the start of the event and on rainfall amount, whereas rainfall intensity presented only a significant correlation with discharge increment. The antecedent conditions seem to be a key point in runoff production, and they explain much of the response. The hydrographs are characterized by a steep rising limb, a relatively narrow peak discharge and slow recession limb. These data and the observations suggest that the subsurface flow is the dominant runoff process. Editor Z.W. Kundzewicz; Associate editor T.

Areas with similar at-a-point hydrological storages were distinguished by using a combination of geology, land use and topography. This mapping was compared with discharge estimates made throughout the catchment following a seven-year return interval flood in September 1997. From this significant flood source areas were identified from reaches showing rapidly increasing channel discharge, and associated with {HYSS} that combined suitable internal characteristics with good connectivity to the main channel. This paper presents a simulation model that has been developed to investigate the way in which the hydrological response of areas within a {HYSS} respond to changes in source area, gradient, connectivity to the channel, storm size and intensity profile. This is one of the first studies using a hillslope model to investigate spatial patterns of runoff-response in semi-arid areas and results have implications for scaling up hydrological response, and on how the dynamics of runoff producing areas vary both under changing storm conditions and over time. It is implicit in our results that the nature of stream–slope coupling differs substantively between semi-arid and humid areas. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Aquifers in permeable formations developed in high-mountain watersheds slow down the transfer of snowmelt to rivers, modifying rivers' flow pattern. To gain insight into the processes that control the hydrologic response of such systems the role played by groundwater in an alpine basin located at the southeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula is investigated. As data in these environments is generally scarce and its variability is high, simple lumped parameter hydrological models that consider the groundwater component and snow accumulation and melting are needed. Instead of using existing models that use many parameters, the Témez lumped hydrological model of common use in Spain and Ibero-American countries is selected and modified to consider snow to get a simplified tool to separate hydrograph components. The result is the {TDD} model (Témez-Degree Day) which is applied in a high mountain watershed with seasonal snow cover in Southern Spain to help in quantifying groundwater recharge and determining the groundwater contribution to the outflow. Average groundwater recharge is about 23\% of the precipitation, and groundwater contribution to total outflow ranges between 70 and 97\%. Direct surface runoff is 1\% of precipitation. These values depend on the existence of snow. Results are consistent with those obtained with chloride atmospheric deposition mass balances by other authors. They highlight the important role of groundwater in high mountain areas, which is enhanced by seasonal snow cover. Results compare well with other areas. This effect is often neglected in water planning, but can be easily taken into account just by extending the water balance tool in use, or any other, following the procedure that has being developed.},

	abstract = {Interflow is the shallow sub-horizontal water flow through the saturated/unsaturated zone generally of a short transit time. It is the main component of the water balance in mountain regions. The study of interflow requires the development of appropriate conceptual models. Its quantification involves challenges due to: (1) the lack of methods to detect and measure it; (2) the possibility of mistaking interflow with local short-time groundwater flow. Therefore, the estimation of interflow is subjected to uncertainties, which in turn lead to errors in the evaluation of other hydrological components. A physically based semi-empirical model of interflow is presented here. It has been implemented in the water balance codes {VISUAL}-{BALAN} and {GIS}-{BALAN} and tested in three Iberian mountain basins: (1) the Valiñas river basin in the {NW} of Spain; (2) the Bernesga basin in the North of Spain; and (3) the Zêzere river basin at the Serra da Estrela in central Portugal. Model results show that the mean annual interflow in these mountain basins ranges from 34 to 55 \% of the annual precipitation. These basins share the following features, which favour interflow: steep slopes and low-permeability layers in the soil. It can be concluded from this study that the evaluation of groundwater resources in mountain basins requires the proper estimation of interflow.},

	abstract = {Groundwater discharge to the Mundo River ({SE}, Spain) has been investigated from 2011 to 2013 by means of 222Rn activities in river water and groundwater. Starting nearby the river source, some 50km of river channel have been studied. The Mundo River is located in the water stressed region of the Segura River Basin. Identifying and quantifying groundwater discharge to rivers is essential for the Hydrological Plan of the Segura Basin Authority. Four main areas of groundwater discharge to the river have been identified by means of 222Rn. Moreover, groundwater fluxes have been quantified using radon activities and, when possible, have been validated with chloride mass balances. The uncertainty range (±2σ) of all water balances has also been assessed. Groundwater discharge ({QGW}) values estimated by radon mass balances ({RMB}) and chloride mass balances ({CMB}) were similar in the river tracts and/or dates in which surface inputs from tributaries were null or negligible. This adds confidence to the {QGW} values estimated by {RMB} in the reaches were {CMB} could not be performed due to the existence of ungauged surface inputs, as is the case of the upper basin of the Mundo River, as well as to the applicability of the method to similar situations. Quantification of groundwater discharge allowed identifying Ayna zone as the main gaining reach of the studied area, with up to 29,553±8667m3day−1 in year 2011. Overall, the total {QGW} estimated by means of {RMB} for the studied area was 8–16\% of the total river flow. The results are coherent with the meteorological conditions of the study period (average rainfall around 450mm/y) and also with the undisturbed situation of the aquifers discharging to the Mundo River in the considered area.},

Furthermore, appropriate filter parameters were suggested for each method in this study. By applying them to 25 stage stations in the Nakdong River in the Republic of Korea, the four methods were evaluated. The results of the evaluation showed that the Chapman and {CM} methods had problems separating the baseflow during the dry seasons. The {EWMA} and {LH} methods were able to achieve reliable baseflow separation of the outcomes by selecting appropriate the filter parameters.

	abstract = {The hydrogeochemical characteristics of springs in the granites of the Spanish Central System ({SCS}), a mountain range affected by cortical tectonic structures, are described, along with an investigation of the spring water origin. In springs with variable flow and where they are associated with minor alterations and fractures, water type is Ca-(Na)-{HCO}3 with low total dissolved solids ({TDS}; 54–200 ppm) and a neutral or slightly acid {pH}. In springs that have continuous flow and association with relevant fractures, water type is Na-{HCO}3, with higher {pH} and {TDS} (240–563 ppm). There are five springs with water type Na-(Ca)-Cl and high {TDS} (780–9,205 ppm) near the {SCS}'s southern tectonic borders. Within 5,000 years of apparent residence time, Ca-(Na)-{HCO}3 water progresses to Na-{HCO}3 type, slightly increasing {HCO}3 content, losing Ca due to calcite precipitation and ionic exchange, and gaining S due to sulphate reduction. No changes are observed after 20,000 years of apparent age. The influence of internal {CO}2 is compatible with Na-{HCO}3 water type characteristics, facilitated by fracturing. Most of the springs yield cold water; thus, a flow depth up to 500 m can be deduced. Only the Messejana-Plasencia fault region shows Na-{HCO}3-type thermal springs. Chloride type water is a result of the influence of the Tertiary basins' water moving towards the southern border of the {SCS}. The reverse fault in such contact, together with the subvertical structures affected by it, are responsible for the springs emerging in the granite. The northern border of the {SCS} shows the opposite behaviour. (English)},

As a result, gridded precipitation data can be valuable for applied climatological research and monitoring, but they too have limitations. To understand the limitations of gridded data more fully (especially when they are used as surrogates for station data), annual precipitation total, rain-day frequency, and annual maxima are calculated and compared for five Midwestern grid points from the Climate Prediction Center’s Unified Rain Gauge Dataset ({URD}) and those of its nearest (rain gauge) station. To further examine differences between the two datasets, return periods of daily precipitation were calculated over a region encompassing Illinois and Indiana. These analyses reveal that the gridding process used to create the {URD} produced nearly the same annual totals as the rain gauge data; however, the gridding significantly increased the frequency of low-precipitation events while greatly reducing the frequency of heavy-precipitation events. Extreme precipitation values also were greatly reduced in the gridded precipitation data. While smoothing nearly always occurs when data are gridded, the gridding of discrete variables such as daily precipitation can produce datasets with statistical characteristics that are very different from those of the original observations.},
