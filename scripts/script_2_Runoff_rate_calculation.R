   #### SCRIPTS FOR ANALYSING HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES: Calculation of Runoff rate and Baseflow contribution ####
   #### Part 1: Runoff rate calculation ####
   
   # Methodology: the runoff rate for 19 subbasins within the upper sector of Tagus River basin has been calculated through this script.
   # Previous csv files were prepared: basins_file and pcp_grid_points, which contain data about the subbasins and their weather data points
   # First, annual precipitation has been calculated using the AEMET grid precipitation data. Daily streamflow data has been extracted 
   # from the CEDEX streamflow gauging stations yearly report and aggregated to annual values to compare with the precipitation.
   # Temperature values in each of the basin has been also obtained in order to discuss the obtained runoff rate values.
