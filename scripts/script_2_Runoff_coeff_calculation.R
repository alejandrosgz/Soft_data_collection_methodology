#### SCRIPTS FOR ANALYSING HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES: Calculation of Runoff coefficient and Baseflow index ####
#### Script 2: Runoff coefficient calculation ####
   
   # Methodology: the runoff coefficient for 19 subbasins within the upper sector of Tagus River basin has been calculated. Through this script,
   # the anual precipitation and the anual runoff have been calculated, deriving the runoff coefficient.
   # Temperature values in each of the basin has been also obtained in order to discuss the obtained runoff rate values.

   # Previous csv files were prepared with Script 1: 1_basins_file and 2_ids_stations_file, which contain data about the subbasins and their weather data points
   # In addition, as input data, daily weather (precipitation and temperature) and streamflow data are being used (see manuscript or README file for more info).
