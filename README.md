# Information about the repository

This repository contains the data and code used to perform the soft-data collection methodology presented in the manuscript *Soft data collection for realistic hydrological modelling: a reproducible methodology developed in R for the Tagus River basin*.

The developed methodology can be reproduced but the authors shall not be liable for their use. 

If the methodology is used, authors will appreciate that the developed manuscript is cited.


### Purpose and utility

Soft data in hydrology can be used to characterize the hydrological behavior of a basin or region, and also to guide hydrological models soft calibration processes. Despite in countries such as Spain there are available weather and hydrological datasets to collect soft data for all the territory, studies which aim to do it are few and limited to small areas and time series. 

In this work, a soft data collection methodology has been developed to obtain soft data from available weather and streamflow data, focusing into two variables: the runoff coefficient and the baseflow index. This methodology can be reproduced for any gauged catchment in Spain, and can be also used for any other region with similar available datasets. The upper sector of the Tagus River basin has been used as study case, evaluating the two variables mentioned in 19 subbasins of this river located in different geological regions.


### Structure

In the main directory of the repository, there are several files:

* **README** This file. It is recommended to read it to know how the repository has been structured and how this methodology can be applied in other regions.

* **soft_data_paper.qmd** Contains all the work and data presented in the manuscript. In this file, the more important parts of the code are located (which can be also found in the scripts) and some examples have been introduced. However, the code for reproducing all the results of the presented manuscript can be found in the **scripts** folder. This document can be used to generate different output formats of the document (**soft_data_paper.docx**, **soft_data_paper.html**), which are also located in the main repository directory. Note that the qmd document has been optimized to rendering to html.

* **Paper_soft_data_collection.bib** contains the references in BibTex format, generated with the software *Zotero*.

Other files are related to the repository functioning or to the output adjustments and can be ignored.


Within the repository, three directories can be found:

#### 1. used_files directory

The data necessary to reproduce the work is located in the **used_files** folder, which contains three folders within:

 * **Created_csv** Contains the csv files that should be created for making the scripts work. To apply this methodology in other regions, these script have to be reproduced as explained in the manuscript or in the corresponding script (Script 1, **script_1_CSV_files_preparation.R**). A vector layer with the weather data grid and a vector layer with the basin/s that will be assessed are necessary to create these files. A brief description of these files follows:
 
    + **1_basins_file.csv** This file contains basic data about the basin or subbasins that will be assessed. Concretely, the name, ID, and area of each basin, and the ID of the gauging station are the fields of this table (*Basin*, *Basin_ID*, *area*, *gauging_code*, respectively). Another field, (which has been named *region* in this case) can be used to group the assessed basins according to any characteristic. Created with Script 1.
    
    + **2_ids_stations_file.csv** Contains the ID, name and location of each weather grid point located within the buffer of each basin (*ID*, *NAME*, *LAT*, *LONG*, *ELEVATION*). The basins where they are located (both ID and name are also indicated, as some points are present in more than one contiguous subbasins). Note that in this case, precipitation and temperature points IDs were the same, but if not one file for each grid should be created and used. Created with Script 1.
    
    + **3_alpha_estimation.csv** This file contains for each basin the alpha obtained with the regression for the three peaks (*alphas*) and their determination coefficients *det_coefs*. The name, ID and region of each basin is also included. Created with the results of the Script 3 (**script_3_alphas_calculation.R**).
    
    + **4_groundwater_results.csv** This file has been used to save the data obtained during the baseflow index estimation. Concretely, for each basin, the alpha and BFImax parameters values used for the filter and the estimated baseflow index (columns *alpha*, *BFImax*, *BF_Rate*, respectively) are stored. Created with the results of the Script 4 (**script_4_Groundwater_contribution_estimation.R**).
 
 * **Data** This directory contains two folders:
 
    + **climate_data_extracted** Contains two folders (one for each variable, *pcp_spain* and *tmp_spain*, respectively) which contain the files with the data for each point of the grid used in this work. Files for all the Spanish territory can be downloaded from (https://swat.tamu.edu/data/spain/). These files have one column with the daily value of the variable, being the name of the column the initial date of the time series (19510101).
    
    + **Gauging_data** Contains the file **afliq.csv**, downloaded from (https://ceh.cedex.es/anuarioaforos/TAJO_csv.asp). This file contains daily streamflow data for all the gauging stations located within the Tagus River basin, and have four columns: the gauging station code (*indroea*), the date (*fecha*), the height of the water (*altura*, which has not been used), and the streamflow (*caudal*, in cubic meters per second).
    
 * **GIS** This directory contains all the vector and raster data used for this work. It have two folders:
 
    + **Shapefiles** Directory that includes the shp (and related) files that has been used for this work: the upper sector of the Tagus River basin (**modeled_basin**), the delineated subbasins (**basins_studied**), weather grids (**grid_tagus**), gauging stations (**gauging_stations**) and the permeability map(**permeabilit_map**).
 
    + **Delineation.zip** Compressed folder which contains three raster layers: the digital elevation model (**ClipMDTproj.tif**) used to create the drainage direction (**drainage_direction_Tagus.tif**) and accumulation rasters (**drainage_acumulation_Tagus.tif**), which were used to delineate the subbasins. This file was compressed to reduce its weight.

#### 2. scripts directory

The code for reproducing all the results of the paper can be found in the folder **scripts**, where 5 scripts are located: 
 
 * **script_1_CSV_files_preparation.R** Can be used to create the csv files needed to use this methodology. As inputs, two vector files (delineated basins and gridded data) are needed.

 * **script_2_Runoff_rate calculation.R** Include all the code necessary to calculate the runoff coefficients at annual and average basis, for subbasins and geological regions. With this script, the annual precipitation, temperature, runoff and runoff coefficient can be calculated.
 
 * **script_3_alphas_calculation.R** Allow to calculate the *alpha* values using a linear regression. Three recession curves for each subbasins have been performed, and the determination coefficient and standard variation values have been extracted.
 
 * **script_4_Groundwater_contribution_estimation.R** Include all the code necessary to apply the baseflow filter for three peaks in each subbasins and calculating the groundwater contribution to the streamflow. 
 
 * **script_5_Plots_scripts.R** Can be used to generate the figures included in the manuscript. Note that Figure 2 it is not possible to be reproduced with the included precipitation data, as it uses data from all the upper third of the Tagus River basin.  


#### 3. Figs directory

**Figs** directory contains the images used in the manuscript


### Instructions for the user

In the manuscript the instructions for reproducing this work can be found, but in this section the main workflow will be explained. 

As inputs for making this assessments in other regions, the user would need to prepare:

* A vectorial file with the basins to be assessed. Instructions for delineating subbasins are located in the section 3.2 of the manuscript. It is recommended to adjust the fields of this layer in order to control the order to calculate the variables, i.e., indicating the name and creating IDs if multiple basins will be assessed. The code of the gauging station for each subbasin have to be included in this vector file or in the csv that it is created from it using the **Script 1**.

* A vector file with the weather data. In this case, a grid has been used, but this is not strictly necessary. Note that, if a grid is not use, the average of the points may be not an accurate interpolation. If precipitation and temperature points/stations are not coincident, two files may be used. A csv file with the points located within a buffer for each assessed basin can be created using the **Script 1**.

If these files are prepared in the same way as in the example, the **Script 2** will work  automatically. In the example case, the subbasins have been grouped by geological regions, but any other characteristic or none can be used. Runoff coefficients will be generated at annual and average basis for the chosen period.

For reproducing the groundwater assessment, as it has been done manually, the user should follow the presented steps, but adapting the code for its streamflow data. This apply for **Scripts 3 and 4**. It is recommended to creater csv files with the results obtained with these scripts, at it has been done in the example.
